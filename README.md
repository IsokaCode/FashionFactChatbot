## Motivation
I am currentlly undergoing a certification in AI and wanted to make a project based around one of my passions outside of technology which is fashion.

The goal was to start of with a simple implementation of a chatbot using AIML and then gradually extend the featured components and capability of the chatbot as and when i learnt them. These components are:

- Rule based and similarity-based
- Image Classifiaction
- First Order Logic and Inference engine
- Cloud based AI
